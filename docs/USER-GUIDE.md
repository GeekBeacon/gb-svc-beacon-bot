## Triggers

Triggers are ways to ensure specific words or phrases aren't used within the guild. Currently, there is support to exclude specific channels, but not support to exclude specific triggers from specific channels.

### Automation Behavior

Triggers have severity levels; low, medium, and high. These are used to determine how the bot will take action. Any time a trigger is seen, the bot will create a log about it in the mod log channel. This follows role hierarchy; meaning that if a mod posts a trigger word/phrase in a non-excluded channel it will report to the super mods (Master Control) and so forth.

**Here is a simple outline of how the bot handles triggers by severity:**
* **High** - These triggers have no place within the guild. Because of this, when these are seen, the bot will instantly delete the message, create a log of it in the appropiate log channel and send a message tagging @here to let mod online know that further action may be required.
* **Medium** - These triggers are important to keep an eye out for. Because of this, the bot will ask the offender to refrain from using the word/phrase.
* **Low** - These triggers aren't as serious, but might need to be kept in specific channels. When these are seen the bot will ask the user to refrain from using the word/phrase.


#### **Command(s) Usage**

| Command     | Argument(s) | Description | Role | Example |
| --- | :---: | --- | :---: | --- |
addtrigger | \<word/phrase\>, \<low \| medium \| high\> | Adds a word/phrase to the trigger list | Super | !addtrigger bad word, medium
removetrigger | \<trigger\> | Removes a trigger word/phrase from the trigger list | Admin | !removetrigger bad word
disabletrigger | \<trigger\> | Disables a trigger in the trigger list | Super | !disabletrigger bad word
enabletrigger | \<trigger\> | Enables a trigger in the trigger list | Super | !enabletrigger bad word
listtriggers | N/A | Displays all the triggers in the list | Mod | !listtriggers

___

These commands are simply for fun, they have no specific purpose except to give users a little bit of interactivity with the bot! Currently there aren't many commands in this category, but that is planned to change!

#### **Command(s) Usage**

| Command     | Argument(s) | Description | Role | Example |
