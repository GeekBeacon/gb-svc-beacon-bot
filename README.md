BeaconBot is a JavaScript [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) bot being built by the [GeekBeacon](www.geekbeacon.org) community. GeekBeacon a community of nerds and geeks who come together to be your guiding light to all things geek. Please join us in our [discord](https://discord.gg/geekbeacon) to see the bot in action and learn more about us. If you would like to contribute, we would love your help to make things better!

BeaconBot is primarily designed for the GeekBeacon Discord, but we have open sourced it to allow others to take inspiration from it, or even mimic some functionality it has/had.

## FAQ (Frequenty Asked Question)

  - Oh god why JavaScript, I want to use {OMG Best Language Ever}? 

I am sure that {OMG Best Language Ever} is the most amazing, feature-rich, language in the world. Although it is likely the best thing since sliced bread and will make all other languages obsolete, we decided not to use it, so I'm afraid you'll have to fork the project and rewrite it yourself if you wish to use it in another language. We decided on javascript because we have a core group of developers that are familiar with the language and it is one of the most popular languages around. (Whether you agree with it or not)

  - I want feature X It would be so great if the bot did X

If you have a feature you'd love to see please open an issue and we'll get to it as soon as we can. It may not be useful for us so it could be a very low priority item. Please vote with emojis, the internet's way of showing popularity these days, if you agree with the issue/feature request. Please note that even if we don't write it you can feel free to submit a pull request.

  - Do I need to create an issue first? 

No, but it would be helpful to track if it's a non-trivial change. If you think your change is fairly straightforward feel free to just submit a PR against the master branch.

  - How can I help?
